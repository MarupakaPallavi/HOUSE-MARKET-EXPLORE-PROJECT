## Project Overview

The objective is to leverage Excel's functionalities and tools to address the following challenges:


● **Data Organization**: The dataset consists of diverse information related to housing prices in California. However, the data may be unstructured, and different columns may have inconsistent formatting. 
The problem is to standardize and organize the data in a consistent manner to facilitate analysis and visualization.


● **Data Cleaning**: The dataset may contain missing values or erroneous entries that can affect the accuracy of analysis. The challenge is to identify and handle such data issues by cleaning and validating the dataset to ensure reliable results.


● **Data Analysis**: With a wide range of variables available, the goal is to conduct comprehensive analysis and gain insights into the California housing market. Find out four minor and four major objectives that might help a customer to find a valuable property there.


● **Visualization**: To effectively communicate findings and enhance data understanding, it is essential to create meaningful visual representations such as charts, graphs, and maps. The challenge lies in selecting appropriate visualization techniques to present the data in a clear and informative manner.
